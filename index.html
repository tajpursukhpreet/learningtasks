            <h1>What is Corruption?</h1>
            <p>According to Transparency.org, We define corruption as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.transparency.org/en/what-is-corruption"></blockquotecite>
                <p>
                "Corruption erodes trust, weakens democracy, hampers economic development and further exacerbates inequality, poverty, social division and the environmental crisis."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Corruption and holding the corrupt to account can only happen if we understand the way corruption works and the systems that enable it. </p>
            <h3>Corruption can take many forms, and can include behaviours like:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>public servants demanding or taking money or favours in exchange for services,</li>
                <li>politicians misusing public money or granting public jobs or contracts to their sponsors, friends and families,
                </li>
                <li>corporations bribing officials to get lucrative deals</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>To Fight Corruption, We Must Embrace Transparency </h3>
            <p>Transparency is all about knowing who, why, what, how and how much. It means shedding light on formal and informal rules, plans, processes and actions. Transparency helps us, the public, hold all power to account for the common good. </p>
            <h3>Costs of Corruption:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Political costs – Your freedom and rule of law.</li>
                <li>Social costs – Your participation and even your trust in government.</li>
                <li>Environmental costs – Your chance for a healthy environment and a sustainable future.</li>
                <li>Economic costs – Your opportunity to build and grow wealth.</li>
            </ul>

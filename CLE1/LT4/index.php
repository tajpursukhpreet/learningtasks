                <h4>Ammy O connor </h4> <br><br>
                <p>The plates will still shift 
                    and the clouds will still spew.
                    The sun will slowly rise 
                    and the moon will follow too.<br><br>
                    Lifeâ€™s beauty will continue to flourish all around,
                   but now you are gone,these birds have no sound.<br><br>
                    And my heart does not beat. It is still inside my chest.
                    My tears keep on falling and my head will not rest.
                    But I have no choice only to move through this life. <br><br>
                   Endlessly attempting to fill this longing that is rife.
